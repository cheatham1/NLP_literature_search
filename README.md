## Use NLP to help with literature searches: extract key sentences

- literature search on keywords and export to csv file

- Read titles and urls from csv file

- Assume most used words in article are the most important, so weight words according to their frequency

- Rank sentences in importance according to the sum of word frequency weight / number words in sentence

- Create summary from the 2 most 'important' sentences per article
